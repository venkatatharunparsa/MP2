# ThreadVerse

A community-driven discussion platform built with Flutter.

## ⚠️ Important Note

This project was initialized manually because the Flutter SDK was not available/working in the environment.
**Platform-specific files (Android, iOS, Web, etc.) are MISSING.**

To fix this and run the app, you must run the following command when you have a working Flutter SDK:

```bash
flutter create .
```

This will generate the `android/`, `ios/`, `web/`, etc. directories without overwriting the `lib/` code.

## Features
